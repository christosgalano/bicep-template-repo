# TODO

- [ ] Include bruh in update_resource_api_versions pipeline (maybe include PR with updated files)
- [ ] Add deployment stack in deploy pipeline after login
- [ ] Add azure_destroy pipeline using the stack
- [ ] Implement a branch deploy model
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Include linting in pipeline
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add license
- [ ] Add PR & issue templates

## Ideas

- Unify the two update pipelines into one, find appropriate name (all changes should create a PR)
